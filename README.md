How to run program

Run main2.py and it should act as a user interface. Follow the prompts at the menus and input "q" to end the program (and the data associated with your local process will be reset).

Note to Avanan team:

I ended up with three different versions because I was confused with this part of the directions:
"Moreover, do not use the python built in data structure, if you have to use a linked list, create one for your own use."

Were we allowed to use dictionaries on this? And I'm confused on whether we may use linked lists, since those are a built in data structure. From the instructions, "...if you have to use a linked list, create one for your own use", were we expected to write our own algorthims to mimick the functionality of linked lists? Dictionaries or linked lists would have been my first bet for this project.

I ended up with 3 main versions but the end results of all are not to my standards:
1. One where I didn't use for loops or arrays/lists (Double lapse of judgement between me and a Q/A friend who I asked for their take on interpreting the instructions). 
2. One where I had nearly completed using sublist and enumerate to process through a 2D array which represented the file system.
3. Similar to #2 except using a nested for loop to locate cd then appending the new mkdir filename to the next array element (coming after the current element where the iterable recognizes cd in the 2D array).

Github contains the files associated with number 2 from the above list but let me know if I should send number 3 as well (a small file with one function replacing the functionality of makedir2.py), because I think I could explain it better.
